   source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```  
4. Install development dependencies (once `requirements-dev.txt` is added):  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```  
5. (Optional) Set up pre-commit hooks for linting/formatting:

## 4. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or run into any problems:

1. Search existing issues to see if itâ€™s already been reported.  
2. If not, open a new issue and include:  
   - A clear, descriptive title  
   - Steps to reproduce the problem  
   - Expected vs. actual behavior  
   - Screenshots or logs, if applicable  

---

## 5. Feature Requests

We welcome ideas for new features! To request a feature:

1. Check the list of open issues/features to avoid duplicates.  
2. Create a new issue with:  
   - A descriptive title  
   - A summary of the proposed feature  
   - Any relevant use cases or sketches  

---

## 6. Development Workflow

We follow a **GitLab flow**:

1. **Branching**  
   - Create a branch per issue or feature:  
     `git checkout -b feat/<short-description>`  
     `git checkout -b fix/<short-description>`  
2. **Work**  
   - Make your changes  
   - Run tests and linters locally  
3. **Commit**  
   - Write clear, concise commit messages (see below)  
4. **Push**  
   - Push your branch to your fork:  
     `git push origin feat/<short-description>`  
5. **Pull Request**  
   - Open a PR against `main` in the upstream repo  
   - Fill out the PR template with details  

---

## 7. Coding Guidelines

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python style.  
- Use meaningful variable and function names.  
- Keep functions short and focused (max ~50 lines).  
- Document public functions and classes with docstrings.  
- For UI code (Tkinter), separate logic from presentation where possible.  
- Write tests for new features/bug fixes.

## 8. Commit Message Format

Use a simple, consistent format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

<body>

<footer>
```

- **type**: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore  
- **scope**: optional area of the code (e.g., `gui`, `core`, `storage`)  
- **short description**: â‰¤50 characters  
- **body**: more detailed explanation (wrap at 72 characters)  
- **footer**: issue references, breaking changes, etc.

Example:

```
feat(core): add JSON-based persistence layer

This adds save_data() and load_data() functions to handle
equipment data in JSON format.

Closes #12
```

## 9. Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.  
2. Run all tests and make sure they pass.  
3. Link related issues in the PR description.  
4. Describe what youâ€™ve done and why.  
5. Request reviews from maintainers.  
6. Address review comments and update your PR.
